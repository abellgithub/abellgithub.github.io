<h2>No More TikTok</h2>
<h3>Jan 17, 2015</h3>

<p>
For reasons not known, the US Congress created a law banning the Chinese-owned phone app,
TikTok, some months ago. Coincidentally, this ban is supposed to go into effect right before the new
administration takes office. Perhaps it was lobbying by AIPAC which didn't like the videos
of the Israeli military bombing and killing Palastinians in Gaza. Perhaps it was Zuck and
friends who thought that they could lobby their way to less competition. Perhaps someone
will talk some day.
</p>

<p>
But the reason that was given in the law that TikTok would be banned was "national security".
One should always, always, always be suspicious of claims of "national security". WTF does
that even mean? If you know that someone is soon going to nuke your cities, then by all means
do what you need to do to stop it. But this is a web app on which people dance, tell stories,
provide news, sell underwear and leggings, give medical advice, tell of tragedies, ask for
support, complain about everything, teach you how to make better coffee, and so on. None of these
things have anything to do with national security and none of them are unavailable on other
phone apps.
</p>
<p>
I believe the stated concern is that China, a "foreign adversary" is storing information
about people in
the US and could use it for nefarious purposes. This is an utter crock of shit. First of all,
China is no "foreign adversary". It is the third-largest trading partner of the US. It isn't
threatening the US in any way other than by doing a better job than the US. A better job at
what, you ask? Well, it's government does a better job in providing basic needs for its
population -- housing, food, public transporation, health care, etc. People are not homeless in
China.  And Chinese
companies are kicking butt compared to many US companies. They produce better products faster
and cheaper than companies in the US. This is why we import so many goods from China. This is
no foreign adversary. It is a country in ascendence while the US is sadly in decline.
</p>

<p>
What awful thing does our Congress think that China is going to do with our personal information
that we have freely shared with all? They haven't said. That's because they don't know. The focus
on China based on their fast development and the perception on the part of the US olds that
China is "communist" and "communist" is bad. Personally, I'm a lot more worried about information
that the US has about me and how it might behave than I am about China. The US actually has
authorities that can come to my home and put me in prison. I don't see any possibility of China
knocking on my door to take me away.
</p>

<p>
The TikTok ban is one more indication of the fear that the US government has of
being left in the dust. And rather than make improvements in the governance and productivity
of the US, it's isolating itself. This is stuff that you would expect from failing countries.
But isolation doesn't work -- take a look around the world to see that quite clearly. Tariffs,
trade sanctions, limiting the ability of Americans to purchase foreign goods and such does
nothing but hurt the US and its people.
</p>

<p>
Today the Supreme Court sided with congress on the ban. They should have stayed out of it. They're
already seen as out-of-touch and bought -- they didn't need to pile on. It does nothing to
improve their perception by citizens.  There was talk of
TikTok, being foreign-owned, not being subject to free speech protections. But that argument
never made any sense -- it was never TikTok's free speech that was at issue -- it was that
of the American people who used TikTok to communicate with one another. Imagine if your
local paper was shut down by the government because the paper was owned by a French corporation.
It would never happen and the argument would never pass muster.
</p>

<p>
We live in a connected world. People will learn about what happens all over this world
with or without TikTok. That the US government thinks it can somehow put the genii back
in the bottle by banning a phone app shows how out of touch it is with the age we live in.
Please do better, US government. Your people deserve it.

<h2>"War" in Gaza</h2>
<h3>Jan 13, 2015</h3>

<p>
Reuters and other news outlets are reporting that there may be agreement on a truce to the
fighting in Gaza. This would be a great thing. But a ceasefire is hardly enough. The people of
Gaza need to live in peace, without threat and be granted the rights and privileges granted
to others rules by the government of Israel. The terrible
price paid by those living in Gaza over the past year should make any moral person sympathetic.
The behavior of the government of Israel has been abhorrent. That a group in Gaza felt no
recourse other than to attack Israel should speak to the despair of Gazans. That Israel retaliated
militarily against people it essentially governed is disgraceful and immoral. The US position
of support for Israel has been disgusting. Providing aid to those whose lives have been destroyed
by bombs that you provided seems like the plot of a farce.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the world is turning. Perhaps there will soon be a time of peace where we will think
about others before ourselves and take care of those in need. But the record isn't good. Perhaps
the ascendence of China will realign powers and priorities. One can only hope. Things seem
to be quickly descending into disfunction in the US. This is not good. But perhaps it can lead
to a new vision for the country and the world. Hopefully this can happen without violence and
pain.
</p>

<h2>Inflation and Interest Rates</h2>
<h3>Jan 10, 2015</h3>

<p>
Long term interest rates (rates on 30-year treasury bonds) have risen to their highest in over
twenty years. This is despite the fact that the US Federal Reserve has recently lowered
short-term interest rates. To a reasonable person, this doesn't make much sense. To Wall St.
types, there is always a reason. In this case, the most plausible reason is that Donald Trump
will soon take office as president and he vows to impose tarriffs on foreign goods. The US consumes
a lot of foreign goods and a tarriff is essentially a tax on those goods (who actually pays
these tarriffs is beside the point).  The thinking is that these tarriffs will be self-imposed
inflation on the cost of goods.
</p>

<p>
This may well be correct. It seems hard to see how businesses will absorb the cost of the tarriffs
and protect consumers for very long. Studies that have examined price behavior after tarriff
imposition have shown that over time, the tarriffs are passed on to consumers, causing price
increases on the goods on which tarriffs are imposed. This is what inflation is -- price
increases.  But will Trump actually impose tarriffs that matter? It's hard to know. Trump KNOWS that
his supporters HATE inflation, so if it occurrs due to tarriffs, they won't likely last.
</p>

<p>
The other expected inflationary action by Trump is a tax cut. The thinking is that if people
pay less in taxes they will buy more stuff. While this thinking makes sense in general,
WHO gets the tax cuts matters. And it matters A LOT. The items on which we measure inflation
are things purchased by "average" American families, not the richest among us. The richest
among us aren't going to buy more bread, eggs, TVs, clothing, etc. because they got a tax
break. They're rich. They can already buy all the bread, eggs, TVs and clothing they want.
It's conceivable that they will buy more land or homes, political campaigns  or airplanes,
but those things don't
much figure into consumer inflation and there are simply too few rich people to move the
needle a lot. Most people don't understand how incredibly rich the people are who would benefit
from
likely Trump tax cuts. They already have all the money the could want, so tax cuts for
them are unlikely to be inflationary.
</p>

<p>
The last worry that I'll mention is the rising federal debt, which would be exaserbated
by a tax cut. For some reason we have created a
system where the federal government offsets (most) spending for which it doesn't collect
taxes by issuing treasury bonds that pay interest. It doesn't have to do this. But
Congress has created a law that requires it. The federal government could just issue
new dollars when it spends without any treasury bond issuance. But what treasury bonds do is
absorb dollars. When people purchase treasury bonds from the government, the dollars they
use to purchase those bonds is destroyed. This would seem a good system but paying interest
over the long run will put more money back into the system. But the important thing to
understand is that money doesn't go away unless you pay a debt to a bank or the government.
Otherwise it just sits there or moves around from person to person (or company to company).
IN THE AGGREGATE the holders of dollars have only two choices to get rid of thier dollars --
pay debt they owe or purchase treasury bonds (or CDs) directly from the issuer. And if
you have a lot of dollars that you don't need, you'd certainly rather get some (any) interest
than just have a bunch of cash. You may make decisions about WHEN is the best time to trade
your cash for bank debt, but sitting on cash for the long-term isn't a winning strategy. (Note
that when the federal government taxes, it also eliminates dollars, but this isn't part
of an investment strategy by the public.)
</p>

<p>
But what does this have to do with interest rates? There is a notion that raising interest rates
lowers inflation and that lowering interest rates increases prices. The evidence for this is
very weak. In the long run, prices go up a little every year. There are several reasons for this.
The "too much money chasing too few goods" is often trotted out, but people pay too much attention
to the first part of the phrase and not enough to the second -- when there aren't enough eggs
because of bird flu, for example, prices tend to rise. How much money people have doesn't
really come into play -- people will only spend so much for an egg. Another clear cause of
inflation is market concentration (monopolys). When there are only two companies that produce
90% of the available cereral, they can easily collude to raise prices until they hit the
point where consumers decide to eat something else for breakfast (maybe not eggs during
a bird flu epidemic :) Sometimes there are governmental interventions that limit supply or
competition. The US government keeps some competetive goods from China (electric cars, cell
phones, etc) either by fiat or the imposition of prohibitive tarriffs.
</p>

<p>
There are places where "too much money" has driven inflation, but this tends to occur when
countries need to increase their money supply to pay foreign debts. These countries also
tend to have a large demand for foreign goods and need to get foreign currency in order to
acquire them. They may also have failing industry due to mismanagement. But "too much money"
is not often the driver of inflation in the US or most countries with strong a internal resource
base.
</p>

<p>
The point here is that rising interest rates may reduce demand of goods, but those goods tend to be
those financed for long periods (homes and cars are what most Americans borrow money to purchase).
Raising interest rates certainly isn't going to eliminate tarriffs that the government imposes.
And furthermore, if tarriffs are imposed and prices increase, without increases in wages, the
tarriffs are THEMSELVES contractionary. You don't need to raise interest rates to get people
to purchase fewer goods -- they'll have no choice because they are paying tarriffs.
</p>

<p>
So, who knows where long-term interst rates will go, but the world is awash with cash and
eventually people will want some return on it. Perhaps they can bet their way to winning
in the stock market, but in the market for every winner there is necessarily a loser. The
system IS a Ponzi scheme. A really good one, but a Ponzi scheme nonetheless.
