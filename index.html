<h2>Inflation and Interest Rates</h2>
<h3>Jan 10, 2015</h3>

<p>
Long term interest rates (rates on 30-year treasury bonds) have risen to their highest in over
twenty years. This is despite the fact that the US Federal Reserve has recently lowered
short-term interest rates. To a reasonable person, this doesn't make much sense. To Wall St.
types, there is always a reason. In this case, the most plausible reason is that Donald Trump
will soon take office as president and he vows to impose tarriffs on foreign goods. The US consumes
a lot of foreign goods and a tarriff is essentially a tax on those goods (who actually pays
these tarriffs is beside the point).  The thinking is that these tarriffs will be self-imposed
inflation on the cost of goods.
</p>

<p>
This may well be correct. It seems hard to see how businesses will absorb the cost of the tarriffs
and protect consumers for very long. Studies that have examined price behavior after tarriff
imposition have shown that over time, the tarriffs are passed on to consumers, causing price
increases on the goods on which tarriffs are imposed. This is what inflation is -- price
increases.  But will Trump actually impose tarriffs that matter? It's hard to know. Trump KNOWS that
his supporters HATE inflation, so if it occurrs due to tarriffs, they won't likely last.
</p>

<p>
The other expected inflationary action by Trump is a tax cut. The thinking is that if people
pay less in taxes they will buy more stuff. While this thinking makes sense in general,
WHO gets the tax cuts matters. And it matters A LOT. The items on which we measure inflation
are things purchased by "average" American families, not the richest among us. The richest
among us aren't going to buy more bread, eggs, TVs, clothing, etc. because they got a tax
break. They're rich. They can already buy all the bread, eggs, TVs and clothing they want.
It's conceivable that they will buy more land or homes, political campaigns  or airplanes,
but those things don't
much figure into consumer inflation and there are simply too few rich people to move the
needs a lot. Most people don't understand how rich the people are who would benefit from
likely Trump tax cuts. They already have all the money the could want, so tax cuts for
them are unlikely to be inflationary.
</p>

<p>
The last worry that I'll mention is the rising federal debt, which would be exaserbated
by a tax cut. For some reason we have created a
system where the federal government offsets (most) spending for which it doesn't collect
taxes by issuing treasury bonds that pay interest. It doesn't have to do this other than
Congress has created a law that requires it. The federal government could just issue
new dollars when it spends without any treasury bond issuance. But what treasury bonds do is
absorb dollars. When people purchase treasury bonds from the government, the dollars they
use to purchase those bonds is destroyed. This would seem a good system but paying interest
over the long run will put more money back into the system. But the important thing to
understand is that money doesn't go away unless you pay a debt to a bank or the government.
Otherwise it just sits there or moves around from person to person (or company to company).
IN THE AGGREGATE the holders of dollars have only two choices to get rid of thier dollars --
pay debt they owe or purchase treasury bonds (or CDs) directly from the issuer. And if
you have a lot of dollars that you don't need, you'd certainly rather get some (any) interest
than just have a bunch of cash. You may make decisions about WHEN is the best time to trade
your cash for bank debt, but sitting on cash for the long-term isn't a winning strategy.
</p>

<p>
But what does this have to do with interest rates? There is a notion that raising interest rates
lowers inflation and that lowering interest rates increases prices. The evidence for this is
very weak. In the long run, prices go up a little every year. There are several reasons for this.
The "too much money chasing too few goods" is often trotted out, but people pay too much attention
to the first part of the phrase and not enough to the second -- when there aren't enough eggs
because of bird flu, for example, prices tend to rise. How much money people have doesn't
really come into play -- people will only spend so much for an egg. Another clear cause of
inflation is market concentration (monopolys). When there are only two companies that produce
90% of the available cereral, they can easily collude to raise prices until they hit the
point where consumers decide to eat something else for breakfast (maybe not eggs during
a bird flu epidemic :) Sometimes there are governmental interventions that limit supply or
competition. The US government keeps some competetive goods from China (electric cars, cell
phones, etc) either by fiat or the imposition of prohibitive tarriffs.
</p>

<p>
The point here is that rising interest rates may reduce demand of goods, but those goods tend to be
those financed for long periods (homes and cars are what most Americans borrow money to purchase).
Raising interest rates certainly isn't going to eliminate tarriffs that the government imposes.
And furthermore, if tarriffs are imposed and prices increase, without increases in wages, the
tarriffs are THEMSELVES contractionary. You don't need to raise interest rates to get people
to purchase fewer goods -- they'll have no choice because they are paying tarriffs.
</p>

<p>
So, who knows where long-term interst rates will go, but the world is awash with cash and
eventually people will want some return on it. Perhaps they can bet their way to winning
in the stock market, but in the market for every winner there is necessarily a loser. The
system IS a Ponzi scheme. A really good one, but a Ponzi scheme nonetheless.
